# git-basics-example

The purpose of this repository is to show off the git flow for use in @kfcampbell's "git basics" demonstration.

## Usage

To run the script, open a terminal and execute `./facts.sh`.

(For Keegan, to separate dummy auth from his machine's auth):
To build the Dockerfile, run `docker build -t facts .` To run the container, run `docker run --rm -it facts`. To connect to that container from VS Code, open the Command Palette and run Attach to Running Container.
